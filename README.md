# Mastery
Fantasy Grounds extension for Index Card RPG supporting ability mastery, as used in Vigilante City and MAGIC

Adds a new area on the bottom of the main tab of the PC sheet, where players can enter a list of Types and the level to which they are mastered (tracked with four checkboxes).
The types entered in the list are matched to the Types of actions used on the Actions tab. By default, types are mainly used with spells, but any action can have any
type. Important note, the TYPE of an action is determined by its source (spell, item, or tag), not when configuring the attempt roll of a particular action.

When an attempt action is performed from the actions tab, if that attempt has an associated cost to be paid, then the cost of any mastered type is reduced by half.
A type is mastered when all four of the checkboxes on the Main tab are filled in. In chat, this is denoted when a cost is paid by adding the text "[MASTERED]" to the output.
